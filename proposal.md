### Project Proposal - Book Topic Modeling

#### Question/need:
* I would like to take the back cover synopsis (blurbs) about a book and see which books are most like each other.
* This will shows which books or authors would be considered most similar and could even lead to a recommendation system of like books to read.
* This analysis would be helpful in categorizing books that are not explicitely one genre or another.

#### Data Description:
* I will be using a Kaggle dataset that was compiled by scraping major book websites. 
* There are 57,510 books included in the dataset.
* Features included in the dataset are: Book title, ISBN, Author, Year, Publisher and the back cover blurb.

#### Tools:
* I will use Python's NLTK library in this topic modeling project.

#### MVP Goal:
* A minimum viable product would be having the top 3-4 topics from the topic model available for analysis.
