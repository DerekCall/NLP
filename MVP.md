# Book Back Cover: Topic Modeling

 My goal has been to separate books into different topics based on the back cover blurb. 
 The back cover of books often include a description or compelling narrative, but also common are reviews by publishers or other authors.
 The dataset I am using has over 57,000 books and I currently have it divided into 12 topic groups.

I will continue to verify if a simple regression model will be most appropriate for this data set. If a Ridge or Lasso model gives a higher r-squared value we will continue with that model on the test data. 

This preliminary analysis has shown that the current rating of the game affects the predicted complexity the most. Other important features are the type of the game and maximum estimated playing time from the manufacturer.
